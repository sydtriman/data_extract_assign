About the raw data
==========================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

About each raw data record
==========================
For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Data transformation
==========================

The original dataset has been transformed as follows:

1. The original training and test data has been merged to create one data set with descriptive variables names. The resultant data set is:  sensor_data

2.  The measurements for mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been extracted into a new data set. The resultant data set is called sensor_data_mean_std_only

3.  The descriptive activity names have been added to the data set. The resultant dataset is: sensor_data_mean_std_only_labelled 

4.  The activity names have been added to the data set.

5.  A dataset containing the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject has been created. The resultant data set is: sensor_data_mean_grouped.
