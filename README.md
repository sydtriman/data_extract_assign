This git contains the Data Extraction Assignment, week 4. 

It contains the R code to do the following:

1. The original training and test data has been merged to create one data set with descriptive variables names. The resultant data set is:  sensor_data

2.  The measurements for mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been extracted into a new data set. The resultant data set is called sensor_data_mean_std_only

3.  The descriptive activity names have been added to the data set. The resultant dataset is: sensor_data_mean_std_only_labelled 

4.  The activity names have been added to the data set.

5.  A dataset containing the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject has been created. The resultant data set is: sensor_data_mean_grouped.
